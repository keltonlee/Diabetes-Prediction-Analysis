# Diabetes prediction analysis

Analyze [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prosperchuks/health-dataset), using ML and DL approaches, to find out the relations between features and targets.

## Data Pre-processing and Visualization
(1) This dataset has no null values and all the data type are already in the form of int64. The dataset has 70692 data and includes 15 features.   

(2) Visualize the corelation between each features and targets.


(3) Scale the data(Standard scale and Min Max scale) to fit in the model so that every feature are in the similar scale. Later I only use Standard scale since most of the data are already binary(0 and 1).
